# A few words about the process

As a first step I downloaded the *create-react-app* in order to have some boilerplate base to work on.
My first concern was to test the API, check in case of need for extra headers etc. I used the native fetch to the simple `/ping` endpoint.
I added `mode: "cors"` as an extra option parameter to avoid cors error. 

After a successful request from `coins/market`, my next step was to show the data properly. I decided to use a table and along with the pagination requirement I thought I need some library with ready components.

I am experienced with a lot UI libraries, but for rapid development I decided to use **material UI**.
Later on, after I had successfully presented the data on a table and with a working pagination, I moved to the **details page**.

A routing mechanism had to be imported and I installed the go-to solution react-router-dom. I created the page and started to play with the data from the endpoint. I assumed that almost all the data are dynamic, that is why I added checks before showing.

 Utilized the Card component and Grid System to show the details. I had in mind the responsiveness of the app, but to be honest I did not spend too much time around an astonishing UI because I think the challenge is more functionality wise.

As a last part created a the `lineChart` component with the help of **chart.js** and **react-chartjs-2** libraries. Created the fetcher function, then casted the data to the appropriate format to inject it to the chart and finally added the number of days to the select component.

It was a fun challenge and I'm looking forward to discussing it together.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
